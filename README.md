Simple React template with configured SSR and server-side script, that works with remote GraphQL to test SSR rendering with Apollo Client on the board.

## Build & start react app:

1. `npm i`

2. `npm run build`

3. `npm run start-ssr`

Open [http://localhost:4010](http://localhost:4010) to view it in the browser.

You can disable JavaScript in your browser and reload website to test pre-rendered result by React SSR.
Also you can measure performance with screenshots to make sure that rehydration process is going smoothly and invisible, without website flashing.
